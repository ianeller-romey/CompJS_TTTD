Entities are divided into components
	- Entity definitions have gameStates
		- Aud/Bhv/Gfx/Phys engines have a list of all active gameStates
		- Game states are used to dictate what should be heard/executed/drawn/collided, without having to delete and recreate
	- Entity instances have priorities
		- Dictated by level layout
		- Priorities are used for clearing levels without deleting everything
	- Gfx definitions have zOrder, renderPass
		- zOrders are rendered from lowest to highest, used to draw layers
		- renderPasses are used so that shaders can affect only certain entities
